# spH4x

## rationale

let's get collaborating on some h4x on everything sp-404 mk2! complete python support for all things serializable from the sp and app would be quite useful for live coding, daw[less] composition, ml/llm hacking, etc.. of course, full sp h/w control would also be worth including as well... for extra credit, reverse engineering the app would be nice to so one wouldn't be limited to only using the app (imagine auv3/vst3 plugins, max8 extensions, mobile, web, etc. version with even more features) and of course a natural language/chat/voice interface for doing our bidding... the sky's the limit!!!
